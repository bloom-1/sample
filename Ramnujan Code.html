        Srinivasa Ramanujan, (born December 22, 1887, Erode, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India">India</a> and died April 26, 1920, Kumbakonam), Indian mathematician whose contributions to the theory of numbers include pioneering discoveries of the properties of the partition function.

        I wrote a diary expressing his toughts about his arrival to Cambridge, England in 1914:

        Dear Diary, I have just arrived in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England">England</a> to start my journey as a mathematician. I left my wife and mother back in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India">India</a>. When I first arrived at Cambridge, I was introduced by John Littlewood, who then escorted me onto campus. The first thing he did which amazed me was to present me with the tree Issac Newton sat on. Then, we arrived at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge">Trinity</a>, where he introduced me to Mr. Hardy. I was so excited and honored to meet him. At <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge">Trinity</a>, people looked at me with disgrace and contempt, which made me feel discriminated against. When I attended my first lecture, the teacher asked me to come to the board and contribute something. I then wrote a formula that shocked the whole class including the teacher. Shortly after, at the end of the lesson, the professor wanted to have a talk with me in regards to the proof I wrote on the board; he was frustrated and offended by that move and told me that I didn’t belong there. His words lowered my confidence and hope of continuing my dream as a mathematician. I then went to Mr.Harvey’s office and talked about that incident with Mr.Howard; he then explained to me that everyone wants me to fail not only because I’m Indian, but because I’m smarter than them. A couple of days later, I went to the post office to check if I received any letters from my family back home, but they’ve found nothing. A British soldier made fun of me and started following me with two of his partners; they started calling me names before beating me up on the street. I wish this first experience would've turned out better and the only thing I can do to stop them is to outsmart them.
